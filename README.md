# Evaluating the Impact of Explainable AI (XAI) on Decision-Making Effectiveness in Financial Services

## Project Overview
This repository supports the MSc Business Analytics dissertation titled:

**“Evaluating the Impact of Explainable AI (XAI) on Decision-Making Effectiveness in Financial Services: A Cross-Industry Comparative Analysis.”**

The project evaluates how explainable AI techniques influence decision-making accuracy, fairness, efficiency, and trust across banking, insurance, and asset management sectors.

## Repository Structure

## Data Sources
This project uses only publicly available datasets:
- UCI Machine Learning Repository (credit and decision datasets)
- Yahoo Finance (financial market data)

Full dataset references are provided in the `data/README_data_sources.md` file.

## How to Run the Code
1. Open the notebooks folder
2. Run notebooks in numerical order (01 → 05)
3. All results and visualisations will be reproduced

## Explainability Techniques Used
- SHAP (global and local explanations)
- LIME (instance-level explanations)
- Counterfactual explanations

## Ethical Considerations
All datasets are anonymised and GDPR-compliant.  
Results are simulated for academic evaluation of decision-making effectiveness.  
Explainability outputs are intended to support human decision-making, not replace it.
